***test21
Tests return values of all logger system calls with illegal parameters
- enable_logging with size = -1
- enable_logging when already enabled
- disable_logging when already disabled
- get_logger_records with user_mem = NULL
- get_logger_records with user_mem = 0xf0000000 (kernel space address) 

***test22
Tests the logger's system calls:
- enable_logging with size = 10
- enable_logging with size = 0
- enable_logging and then disable_logging
- enable_logging with size = 100, 
  forking up to 200 processes and check that the logger is full and correct.

***test23
Tests the logger's system calls:
- Testing cross processes logger functionality
- Performing stress tests

***test24
Tests the scheduler's system calls with illegal scenarios:
- start_orig_scheduler when already enabled
- start_lottery_scheduler when already enabled

***test25
Tests the scheduler functionality:
- start_lottery_scheduler
- start_orig_scheduler
- set_max_tickets to 1 and testing that indeed only 
  the process with the best priority is able to run
- set_max_tickets to -1 and testing that the limit has canceled.


***test26
Tests the scheduler functionality:
- start_lottery_scheduler and start_orig_scheduler 
  alternately for 100 times 
- forking up to 100000 processes

***************************** Didn't grade ************************************
***test27
Tests sched_setscheduler:
- Testing the sched_setscheduler under the original scheduler
- Testing the sched_setscheduler under the lottery scheduler 
***************************** Didn't grade ************************************

***test28
Tests originated FIFO processes:
- Testing that an originated FIFO process have 
  a quantum under the lottery scheduler

***test29
Tests that the original behavior of effective prio still holds

Note: If a test timed out, it means that something didn't went as expected.
(i.e it doesn't necessarily mean you have an infinite loop or a deadlock)
